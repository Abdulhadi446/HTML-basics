# HTML-basics

Learning HTML fundamentals across 10 lessons. This repository contains a small set of static example pages (HTML, CSS, and images) used to practice basic web development concepts.

## Summary

- Project: HTML-basics
- Purpose: Follow along and practice HTML & CSS across 10 short lessons.
- Files: Each lesson is contained in `Lesson X/` directories and typically includes `index.html`, `about.html` (when present), `styles.css`, and an `img/` folder for images.

## Contents (per-lesson)

Note: briefly lists the main files present in each lesson folder.

### Lesson 1

- `index.html`

### Lesson 2

- `index.html`
- `styles.css`

### Lesson 3

- `index.html`
- `styles.css`

### Lesson 4

- `index.html`
- `styles.css`

### Lesson 5

- `index.html`
- `about.html`
- `styles.css`

### Lesson 6

- `index.html`
- `about.html`
- `styles.css`
- `img/` (several images: `caribbean.jpg`, `html_logo_300_300.png`, `html1.png`, `html2.png`, `html3.png`, `html4.jpg`, `vocation.jpg`)

### Lesson 7

- `index.html`
- `about.html`
- `styles.css`
- `img/` (same image set as Lesson 6)

### Lesson 8

- `index.html`
- `about.html`
- `styles.css`
- `img/` (`html1.png`, `html2.png`, `html3.png`, `html4.jpg`, `html_logo_300_300.png`, `caribbean.jpg`, `vocation.jpg`)

### Lesson 9

- `index.html`
- `about.html`
- `styles.css`
- `img/` (image set similar to Lessons 6â€“8)

### Lesson 10

- NOTE: Lesson 10 is intended as a personal project and its folder is intentionally excluded from this repository (it is listed in `.gitignore`).

- Create your own `Lesson 10/` folder locally to practice building a small project. Typical files to add:

  - `index.html` (entry page)
  - `styles.css` (styles)
  - optional pages like `about.html`, `contact.html`, `hours.html`, `pricing.html`
  - `img/` for assets (icons, screenshots, etc.)

- Because the `Lesson 10/` folder is ignored by git, your local work won't be committed unless you remove it from `.gitignore` or explicitly add files with `git add -f`.

## How to view the lessons

- Open a lesson's `index.html` file in any modern browser (double-click or use the browser "Open File" feature).
- For live editing, use a simple static server or VS Code Live Server extension to serve the folder and view changes in real time.

## Conventions and assumptions

- Each `Lesson X/` directory is a self-contained static example for that lesson. Some lessons include an `about.html` or additional pages to practice linking between pages.
- Images live in an `img/` subfolder where present.

## Suggested next steps

- Add short descriptions inside each lesson folder (e.g., a `README.md` or comments in `index.html`) describing what concept the lesson covers.
- Add screenshots or small tests to show the expected result for each lesson.
- Consider adding a top-level `index.html` that links to all lesson entry pages for easier navigation.

## Notes

This repository contains personal learning exercises for practicing HTML and CSS.
